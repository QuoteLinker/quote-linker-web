### Setting Your Lead Preferences

Fine-tune your lead preferences to receive the most valuable prospects:

- **Customer demographics**: Age ranges, property types, etc.
- **Coverage needs**: Policy limits, specialized coverages
- **Lead volume controls**: Daily/weekly maximum
- **Delivery schedule**: Immediate, batched, or scheduled

Properly configured preferences ensure you receive leads that match your expertise and business goals.

## Best Practices for Lead Management

### Speed of Response

Research shows that response time dramatically impacts conversion rates:
- Responding within 5 minutes: 21% conversion
- Responding within 30 minutes: 11% conversion
- Responding after 30 minutes: <5% conversion

Tips for improving response time:
1. Enable mobile notifications
2. Use the QuoteLinker mobile app for on-the-go responses
3. Set up auto-responders for after-hours leads
4. Consider using QuoteLinker's Lead Connect service for 24/7 initial contact

### Effective Follow-Up Strategy

Persistence pays off in lead conversion:
- 80% of sales require at least 5 follow-up attempts
- Only 10% of agents follow up more than 3 times

Develop a systematic follow-up sequence:
1. Immediate response (call and email)
2. Same-day second attempt
3. Next-day follow-up
4. 3-day check-in
5. 1-week follow-up
6. 2-week follow-up
7. Monthly check-ins for long-term prospects

Use the QuoteLinker CRM integration to automate and track these touchpoints.

### Lead Nurturing

Not all leads are ready to buy immediately. Implement a nurturing strategy:

- Segment leads based on their timeline and needs
- Provide valuable information tailored to their insurance interests
- Use QuoteLinker's email templates for consistent communication
- Schedule periodic check-ins for future opportunities
- Add value beyond quotes (risk assessments, coverage reviews)

### Performance Tracking

Monitor your lead performance metrics in your QuoteLinker dashboard:
- Contact rate
- Quote rate
- Conversion rate
- Cost per acquisition
- Return on investment
- Lead quality scores

Use these insights to optimize your approach and lead preferences.

## Maximizing Your ROI

### Calculate Your Numbers

Know your lead economics:
```
Cost per lead: $X
Contact rate: Y%
Quote rate: Z%
Close rate: A%
Average commission: $B
Average retention: C years

ROI = ((B × A% × Z% × Y% × C) - X) / X
```

Use the QuoteLinker ROI calculator to determine your optimal lead investment.

### Quality vs. Quantity

Consider these approaches:
1. **High-volume strategy**: More leads at lower cost per lead
   - Works well for simple products with quick sales cycles
   - Requires efficient processes and follow-up systems

2. **Premium lead strategy**: Fewer, higher-quality leads at higher cost
   - Better for complex products with higher commissions
   - Allows for more personalized service

Most successful agents find a balanced approach works best.

### Cross-Selling and Referrals

Maximize lifetime value from each lead:
- Identify cross-sell opportunities during initial conversations
- Request referrals from satisfied clients
