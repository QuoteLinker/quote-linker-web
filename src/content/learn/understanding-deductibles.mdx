# Understanding Insurance Deductibles: A Complete Guide

Insurance deductibles play a crucial role in your coverage and costs. Understanding how they work helps you make better decisions about your insurance policies.

## What is a Deductible?

A deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage begins. For example, if you have a $500 deductible and a $2,000 claim, you'll pay $500 and your insurance will cover the remaining $1,500.

## How Deductibles Work

### Types of Deductibles
1. Per-incident deductibles
   - Apply to each claim
   - Common in auto insurance

2. Annual deductibles
   - Reset each year
   - Common in health insurance

3. Split deductibles
   - Different amounts for different types of claims
   - Common in homeowners insurance

## Impact on Premiums

Deductibles directly affect your premium costs:
- Higher deductible = Lower premium
- Lower deductible = Higher premium

### Finding the Right Balance
Consider these factors:
- Your emergency savings
- Monthly budget
- Risk tolerance
- Claim likelihood

## Deductibles by Insurance Type
