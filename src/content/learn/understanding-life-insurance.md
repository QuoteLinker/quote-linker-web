## What is Life Insurance?

Life insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company. In exchange for premium payments, the insurance company provides a death benefit to your beneficiaries when you pass away.

## Types of Life Insurance

### Term Life Insurance
- Provides coverage for a specific period (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years)
- Generally more affordable than permanent life insurance
- No cash value accumulation
- Ideal for temporary needs like mortgage protection or children's education

### Permanent Life Insurance
- Provides coverage for your entire life
- Includes a cash value component that grows over time
- Higher premiums than term life insurance
- Suitable for long-term financial planning and estate planning

## How to Choose the Right Coverage

1. **Assess Your Needs**
   - Calculate your financial obligations
   - Consider your family's future expenses

2. **Determine Coverage Amount**
   - Rule of thumb: 10-15 times your annual income
   - Consider your specific circumstances
   - Factor in existing assets and insurance

3. **Choose the Right Policy Type**
