Your home is likely your most valuable asset, and homeowners insurance is essential for protecting it against unexpected events. This guide will help you understand the basics of homeowners insurance and how to choose the right coverage for your needs.

## What Homeowners Insurance Covers

A standard homeowners insurance policy typically includes:

2. **Personal Property Coverage**: Covers your belongings
3. **Liability Protection**: Covers legal expenses if someone is injured on your property

## Understanding Coverage Limits

When choosing coverage limits:

1. **Dwelling Coverage**: Should equal the cost to rebuild your home
