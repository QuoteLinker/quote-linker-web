QuoteLinker Build Context

QuoteLinker is not just building a quote form. You are building a **trust engine** that turns traffic into policies with zero friction.

What You're Really Building:
- A **trust funnel** for consumers to take action on insurance confidently
- A **growth engine** for licensed agents and agencies to scale
- A **conversion-first platform** built for SEO, automation, and future CRM/AI integration

Core Product Principles:
- Every improvement must help a real person **find, trust, and act** on insurance
- Each product page (e.g. /life, /disability, /auto) should:
  - Auto-fill the insurance type
  - NEVER show a type selector
  - Include only relevant, clean fields
  - Submit data via a Zapier webhook (mock for now)
- After form submit, users should:
  - See a beautiful **thank-you screen**
  - Be offered a **Calendly embed** to book with an agent
  - Receive no spam, no calls from multiple agents

UX/UI Requirements:
- Responsive on mobile (especially iPhone 12 width)
- Clean Tailwind design
- Bold CTA like “Get My Free Quote”
- Use consistent layout and colors from QuoteLinker.com (including logo)

Tech Stack:
- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Zapier Webhooks** for lead capture
- **Vercel** deployment

Phase 2 (Coming Soon):
- CRM: Salesforce
- Phone: OpenPhone
- Email/SMS: MailerSend, Resend, or similar
- Agent portal (login, lead tracking, Stripe billing)
- Fully AI-integrated follow-up and campaign workflows
All AI-generated improvements must follow these principles and support QuoteLinker’s position as the next QuoteWizard, built for the modern insurance economy.
