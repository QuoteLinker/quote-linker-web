## üéØ The Problem

Insurance agents and licensed insurance producers face two major challenges in acquiring new business in the digital era:

1. **Overpriced Leads**: Paying $50-100 per lead that is unlikely to convert
2. **Low Intent**: Receiving leads from users who aren't serious about buying insurance which lowers closing KPIs

Consumers struggle with:

1. **Complex Process**: Lengthy forms and multiple agent calls
2. **Uncertainty**: Not knowing if they're getting the best rates
3. **Spam**: Getting bombarded with calls from multiple agents

## üí° The Solution

- **No Spam**: Leads are distributed to one agent at a time
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for qualified leads that match your expertise

### For Consumers

- **Simple Process**: One form, multiple quotes from local agents
- **Quality Matches**: Connect with licensed agents in your area
- **No Spam**: Your information is shared with one agent at a time
